    Operator which draws random gain errors from a given
    distribution and applies them to the specified detectors.

    Args:
        center (float):  Gain distribution center.
        sigma (float):  Gain distribution width.
        pattern (str):  Regex pattern to match against detector names.
            Only detectors that match the pattern are scrambled.
        name (str):  Name of the output signal cache object will be
            <name_in>_<detector>.  If the object exists, it is used as
            input.  Otherwise signal is read using the tod read method.
        realization (int): if simulating multiple realizations, the
            realization index.
        component (int): the component index to use for this noise
            simulation.

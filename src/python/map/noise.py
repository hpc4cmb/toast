class OpAccumDiag(Operator):
    """
    Operator which accumulates the diagonal covariance and noise weighted map.

    This operator requires that the local pointing matrix has already been
    computed.  Each process has local pieces of the map products.  This
    operator can optionally accumulate any combination of the hit map,
    the white noise weighted map, and the diagonal inverse pixel covariance.

    NOTE:  The input DistPixels objects (noise weighted map, hit map, and
    inverse covariance) are purposefully NOT set to zero at the start.  This
    allows accumulating multiple instances of the distributed data.  This might
    be needed (for example) if all desired timestream data does not fit into
    memory.  You should manually clear the pixel domain objects before
    accumulation if desired.

    Args:
        zmap (DistPixels):  (optional) the noise weighted map to accumulate.
        hits (DistPixels):  (optional) the hits to accumulate.
        invnpp (DistPixels):  (optional) the diagonal covariance matrix.
        detweights (dictionary): individual noise weights to use for each
            detector.
        name (str): the name of the cache object (<name>_<detector>) to
            use for the detector timestream.  If None, use the TOD.
        flag_name (str): the name of the cache object (<flag_name>_<detector>) to
            use for the detector flags.  If None, use the TOD.
        flag_mask (int): the integer bit mask (0-255) that should be 
            used with the detector flags in a bitwise AND.
        common_flag_name (str): the name of the cache object 
            (<common_flag_name>_<detector>) to use for the common flags.  
            If None, use the TOD.
        common_flag_mask (int): the integer bit mask (0-255) that should be 
            used with the common flags in a bitwise AND.
        apply_flags (bool): whether to apply flags to the pixel numbers.
        pixels (str): the name of the cache object (<pixels>_<detector>)
            containing the pixel indices to use.
        weights (str): the name of the cache object (<weights>_<detector>)
            containing the pointing weights to use.

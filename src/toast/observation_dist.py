    """Class used within an Observation to store the detector and sample distribution.

    This is just a simple container for various properties of the distribution.

    Args:
        samples (int):  The total number of samples.
        detectors (list):  The full list of detector names.  Note that detector_sets
            may be used to prune this full list to only include a subset of detectors.
        detector_sets (list or dict):  (Optional) List of lists containing detector
            names or dictionary of lists with detector names (the keys are irrelevant).
            These discrete detector sets are used to distribute detectors- a detector
            set will always be within a single row of the process grid.  If None,
            every detector is a set of one.
        sample_sets (list):  (Optional) List of lists of chunk sizes (integer numbers of
            samples).  These discrete sample sets are used to distribute sample data.
            A sample set will always be within a single column of the process grid.  If
            None, any distribution break in the sample direction will happen at an
            arbitrary place.  The sum of all chunks must equal the total number of
            samples.
        comm (toast.Comm):  The communicator to use.
        process_rows (int):  (Optional) The size of the rectangular process grid
            in the detector direction.  This number must evenly divide into the size of
            comm.  If not specified, defaults to the size of the communicator.

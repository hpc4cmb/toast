    """Create a PixelDistribution from a pre-defined sky footprint.

    Usually a PixelDistribution object is created by passing through the detector
    pointing and determining the locally hit submaps.  However, this can be expensive
    if the data must be loaded from disk and if there is insufficient memory to hold
    the detector data in a persistent way.

    This function provides a way for building a PixelDistribution where all processes
    have the full footprint locally, regardless of whether their local detector
    pointing hits all submaps.  For high resolution sky products with many processes
    per node, use of shared memory may be required.

    Only certain combinations of options are supported:

    1.  If `wcs_coverage_file` is specified, that is taken to be the WCS projection
        of the coverage.  The number of pixels is set by the extent of the WCS, NOT
        the actual pixel values.  The number of submaps is set to one.  All healpix
        options should be None.
    2.  If `healpix_coverage_file` is specified, the NSIDE of the file is used to
        define the number of pixels and the non-zero pixel values along with
        `healpix_nside_submap` is used to compute the nonzero submaps in this coverage.
        The same hit submaps are used across all processes.
    3.  If `healpix_submap_file` is specified, non-zero values represent the hit
        submaps.  `healpix_nside` is then used to define the NSIDE and the number of
        pixels.
    4.  If neither file is specified, `healpix_nside` is used to define the NSIDE and
        number of pixels.  `healpix_nside_submap` is used to compute the number of
        submaps.  All submaps are considered hit in this case.

    Args:
        healpix_nside (int):  If specified, the NSIDE of the coverage map.
        healpix_nside_submap (int):  If specified, the NSIDE of the submaps.
        healpix_coverage_file (str):  The path to a coverage map.
        healpix_submap_file (str):  The path to a map with the submaps to use.
        wcs_coverage_file (str):  The path to a WCS coverage map in the primary HDU.
        comm (MPI.Comm):  The MPI communicator or None.

    Returns:
        (PixelDistribution): The output pixel distribution.

    This operator runs the pointing operator and builds the PixelDist instance
    describing how submaps are distributed among processes.  This requires expanding
    the full detector pointing once in order to compute the distribution.  This is
    done one detector at a time unless the save_pointing trait is set to True.

    NOTE:  The pointing operator must have the "pixels" and "create_dist"
    traits, which will be set by this operator during execution.

    Output PixelDistribution objects are stored in the Data dictionary.

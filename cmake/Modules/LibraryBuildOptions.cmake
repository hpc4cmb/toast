# - Setup of general build options for  Libraries
#
# In addition to the core compiler/linker flags (configured in the
# MakeRules_<LANG>.cmake files), the build may require
# further configuration. This module performs this task whicj includes:
#
#  1) Extra build modes for developers
#  2) Additional compiler definitions to optimize
#     performance.
#  3) Additional compiler flags which may be added optionally.
#  4) Whether to build shared and/or static libraries.
#

# However, exercise care when doing this not to override existing flags!!
# We don't do this on WIN32 platforms yet because of some teething issues
# with compiler specifics and linker flags

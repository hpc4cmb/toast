# Example Configurations

This directory contains a variety of examples for how to configure toast with
cmake using a variety of upstream dependencies. Below we cover the most common.

## Building with Conda Compilers

If you have a base conda environment loaded, you can create a new conda env
with all toast dependencies by doing:

    $> mkdir build
    $> cd build
    $> ../platforms/conda_dev_setup.sh <new env>

Where "new env" is the name or path of the environment to create and populate
with dependencies. Next, activate the new environment.

    $> conda activate <new env>

And now configure toast to use all the conda-provided dependencies and install
to the conda prefix:

    $> cd build
    $> ../platforms/conda_dev.sh
    $> make -j 4 install

## Using NVHPC for GPU Support with OpenMP Target

When using OpenMP target offload, the internal compiled extension is built with
a compiler (such as the NVHPC SDK compilers) that support both the modern
OpenMP standard and the GPU device on the system. TOAST also requires a BLAS /
LAPACK library, and this must be compatible with the OpenMP implementation used
to build TOAST.

For this example, we will use the NVHPC-provided BLAS and LAPACK libraries and
compile other dependencies with the NVHPC compilers. The following example is
on the perlmutter system at NERSC:

    $> module load python
    $> module use /global/common/software/cmb/perlmutter/nvhpc/modulefiles
    $> module load nvhpc-nompi/23.7

Next, setup a build directory (for example, on scratch) and decide where to
install the software. For the purposes of this example, we will build software
in `${SCRATCH}/build_nvhpc` and install software to `${HOME}/toast_nvhpc`.  We
are installing optional dependencies (MPI, libconviqt, etc) with the "yes"
option.

    $> cd ${SCRATCH}/build_nvhpc
    $> MPICC=cc MPICXX=CC MPIFC=ftn \
        ${HOME}/git/toast/platforms/venv_dev_setup_nvhpc.sh \
        ${HOME}/toast_nvhpc yes | tee log 2>&1

This will create a virtualenv in `${HOME}/toast_nvhpc` and then install our
compiled dependencies into that directory. To load these tools into our
environment, we can use a small shell helper function defined in this source
file here:

    $> source ${HOME}/git/toast/packaging/venv/load_venv.sh
    $> load_venv ${HOME}/toast_nvhpc

Now we are finally ready to compile toast itself. This script will run cmake
and configure the installation to the dependencies in our virtualenv:

    $> cd ${SCRATCH}/build_nvhpc
    $> ${HOME}/git/toast/platforms/venv_dev_nvhpc.sh
    $> make -j 4 install

As always, run the unit tests to verify the installation. You can enable GPU
use by setting `TOAST_GPU_OPENMP=1` and `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY` in your
shell environment.

## Enabling GPU Support with JAX

For any software stack (using conda compilers, NVHPC, etc), you can [install
JAX using the official instructions
here](https://github.com/google/jax#installation). You can enable JAX code by
setting `TOAST_GPU_JAX=1` in your shell environment.

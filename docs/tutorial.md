# Tutorial

The TOAST tutorial is based on a series of notebooks that were presented
in past workshops. You can find them inside the `tutorial` directory in
the [top level of the source
tree](https://github.com/hpc4cmb/toast/tree/master/tutorial). These
notebooks are designed to be run interactively from a laptop or
workstation. To avoid adding binary objects to the git repository, these
notebooks do not have any outputs saved. You can either run them to view
the output or you can browse a copy of the [generated output
here](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/cmb/toast-tutorial/).

# Using Git for Development


We use the git distributed version control system for development. Git
is incredibly powerful compared to older centralized version control
systems like CVS or Subversion. In particular, git allows developers to
make progress independently while still being able to coalesce their
work into a functioning product at the end. In addition to the
underlying git version control system, we make extensive use of github
features such as pull requests and \"actions\", which we use for
continuous integration testing.

There is extensive online documentation about how to use git itself, and
also how to use tools provided by github. Here we focus on just the best
practices we try to use in TOAST development.

```{note}
Many git documents describe the use of \"git pull\" or \"git pull
\--rebase\", which under-the-hood actually do a \"fetch\" followed by
either a \"merge\" or \"rebase\". This document avoids those shortcuts
to make it more clear what is happening.
```

## Starting Out

Unless you are on the core development team, you cannot push directly to
the primary TOAST git repo. Instead, you should \"fork\" the TOAST repo
into your own github account. Then clone that repo locally and add the
primary TOAST repo as the \"upstream\" remote. See [the github
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks)
for more details about using forks. For the rest of this section, we
assume that you have your fork set up and you have a local git clone of
this repo (i.e. the \"origin\" remote points to your fork) and that the
\"upstream\" remote points to the main TOAST repo.

```{note}
Make sure to set up your ssh keys with github and run an ssh agent,
keychain, or similar tool on your system so that you do not need to type
a password for every command that communicates with github.
```

### Staying Up to Date

As you work on branches in your local clone, you should periodically
synchronize the main development branch between the upstream repo and
your forked repo. You can do this with:

```{code-block} console
# Switch to your local checkout of main
git checkout main
# Fetch a copy of all the branches in your fork.
# Also delete any copies of branches that no
# longer exist in your fork.
git fetch origin
git remote prune origin
# Fetch a copy of all the branches upstream, and
# prune any branches that were deleted upstream.
git fetch upstream
git remote prune upstream
# Rebase your local checkout of main against
# your fork.
git rebase origin/main
# Rebase your local checkout of main against
# the upstream version
git rebase upstream/main
# Push your up-to-date copy of main to your fork
git push origin main
```

This sequence should always work, since you should never be committing
things directly to main. All work should occur in a branch (see below).
Since the above set of commands is tedious, you can create a shell alias
for these (except for the first line)if you like. For example, putting
this in `~/.bashrc` (name it whatever you like):

```{code-block} console
git-sync-main () {
    # Check that we are on the main branch so that we
    # do not rebase on the wrong local branch
    current=$(git branch --show-current)
    if [ "x${current}" != "xmain" ]; then
        echo "You must checkout the main branch before running this command"
    else
        git fetch origin
        git remote prune origin
        git fetch upstream
        git remote prune upstream
        git rebase origin/main
        git rebase upstream/main
        git push origin main
    fi
}
```

Now you can synchronize your local copy of main (and also keep your
clone directory tidy) with:

```{code-block} console
git checkout main
git-sync-main
```

### Working on a Branch

Whether you are hacking on a long-term development project or making a
small pull request to fix a bug, you should work on a branch.

-   setting up the branch
-   making commits: set EDITOR to what you want

You should periodically rebase your branch off of main in order to keep
up to date with other upstream changes, and also to resolve any
conflicts as they come up- rather than dealing with them all at once at
the end when you open a pull request. First, commit any changes on your
branch and then synchronize your local checkout of main (using the shell
function described previously, or manually):

```{code-block} console
git checkout main
git-sync-main
```

Now rebase your branch against your local checkout of main:

```{code-block} console
git checkout mybranch
git rebase main
# If there are some small conflicts, open the conflicting files
# in an editor and search for "<<<<<" and then edit it as needed.
# Note that both the Atom editor and VS Code have graphical
# displays that let you easily select which one you want (or both)
# with a single click.  Then save the files and mark them resolved
# and continue.
git add path/to/file
git add other/file/with/conflicts
git rebase --continue
# Eventually all of your commits will be replayed and the rebase
# will be done.  If things get really crazy, do
git rebase --abort
# And see the section, "When Things Go Wrong" below.
# Now we can force-push our copy of mybranch back to the origin
git push -f origin mybranch
```

-   why rebase instead of merge: linear history, fewer useless merge
    commits, easier to follow what changes are being introduced.
-   when to merge: \"permanent\" or very long-lived branches, merging
    feature branches into main.

## When Things Go Wrong

No matter how much experience we have with git, sometimes bad things
hkappen. This might be from accidental work flow errors in our own local
checkout or it might be due to ustream changes that introduce big
conflicts with our local work. Here is a sequence of steps that can be
attempted to fix the situation.

### Repeated Conflicts During Rebase

Sometimes attempting to rebase a branch against main causes repeated
conflicts. This can happen if you have merged main into you local branch
and then made modifications to that code. During the rebase, each commit
is replayed onto the tip of main. You may resolve one conflict only to
have it reappear on the next round of `git rebase --continue`. This
issue can often be resolved by aborting the rebase and first squashing
all the changes in your branch into a single commit. This way all that
matters is the change from the starting point to the end point, rather
than intermediate commits that make one change followed by later commits
that undo that change.

If you are new to doing interactive rebasing (in order to squash), then
I recommend first making a copy of your working branch:

```{code-block} console
# Switch to your branch
git checkout mybranch
# Checkout a new branch that is a copy of this
git checkout -b mybranch_copy
```

Now type `git log` and find the commit hash that was just before your
first commit. Copy this hash. Now interactively rebase your branch
against this starting point:

```{code-block} console
git rebase -i <commit hash before your first commit>
# Follow instructions and in your editor, mark the first
# commit in the list as one to keep, and mark the rest
# with "S" for squash.  Save and exit your editor.
# Now edit the full commit message for your one big
# commit.  You can rephrase your commit messages or just
# make them into a big list.  Save and exit your editor.
```

Now if you type `git log` you will see all of your work as one big
commit with your new detailed commit message. Now that your work is
contained in one large commit, we can try to rebase this against main:

```{code-block} console
git rebase main
```

Now resolve any conflicts. You will only have to resolve these once,
since there is only one commit now. If you started this work on a copy
of your original branch, now you can push your copied branch and open a
new pull request from this copy. Once it is merged, you can clean up
both the copy and the original from your local clone.

### Last Resort

Sometimes you may be dealing with a situation where the branch you are
working with is very out of date, or includes a mixture of rebasing and
merging against main. This garbles the history and makes it challenging
or impossible to cleanly rebase against main. In some cases, such a
branch may even include unintentional reverting of changes in main from
other upstream merges.

-   manually go through the full diff and make sure all changes are
    intended, and not actually reverting things that it should not.
    Merge this into main, even if it makes the history a mess.
-   copy files with changes into a temporary location, and then make a
    new branch from main. Copy the changed files into the new branch and
    do any cleanups. Delete the original branch.

## Conclusion

For TOAST development, we prefer to keep our history as linear as
possible. Please avoid merging the upstream branch into your development
branch. Instead, use `git fetch` and `git rebase` (or
`git pull --rebase`) when updating branches from the upstream repo. When
merging large branches with many changes, please rebase those branches
against current main before a pull request is reviewed / merged. Small
or trivial pull requests against recent versions of main are fine to
merge without rebasing.

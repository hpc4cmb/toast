Tutorial
=================================

The TOAST tutorial is based on a series of notebooks that were presented in past
workshops.  You can find them inside the ``tutorial`` directory in the top level of the
source tree.  These notebooks are designed to be run interactively from a laptop or
workstation.  To avoid adding binary objects to the git repository, these notebooks do
not have any outputs saved.  You can either run them to view the output or you can
browse a copy of the `generated output here
<https://portal.nersc.gov/project/cmb/toast-tutorial/>`_.

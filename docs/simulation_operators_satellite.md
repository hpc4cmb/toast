# Simulated Satellite Observing

Simulating artificial observing from a satellite instrument consists of two parts:
building an observing \"schedule\" and then simulating telescope motion using that
schedule.  A satellite schedule contains a list of scans, which describe the overall
telescope motion for some length of time:

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: toast.schedule.SatelliteScan
    :members:
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: toast.schedule.SatelliteSchedule
    :members:
```

For generating large schedules, it is best to use the included commandline tool:

```{include} toast_satellite_schedule.inc
```

Which writes the schedule to an ECSV file.  This file can then be loaded before passing
it to the `SimSatellite` operator.  Alternatively, for small tests, you can build a
schedule directly in memory by calling the underlying function:

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: toast.schedule_sim_satellite.create_satellite_schedule
```

After you have a `SatelliteSchedule` created or read from disk, you can use the
`SimSatellite` operator to actually generate observations:

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: toast.ops.SimSatellite
    :members:
```

This operator will append observations (using the schedule) to the `Data` container
passed to the `exec()` method.  The observations will contain simulated telescope
pointing, and will have the detector timestreams initialized to zero- ready for calling
other simulation operators to generate detector signals.
